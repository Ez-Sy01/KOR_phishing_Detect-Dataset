## Abstract

In South Korea, the rapid proliferation of smartphones has led to an uptick in messenger phishing attacks associated with electronic communication financial scams. In response to this, various phishing detection algorithms have been proposed. However, collecting messenger phishing data poses challenges due to concerns about its potential use in criminal activities. Consequently, a Korean phishing dataset can be composed of imbalanced data, where the number of general messages might outnumber the phishing ones. This class imbalance problem and data scarcity can lead to overfitting issues, making it difficult to achieve high performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a phishing messages classification method using Biased Discriminant Analysis without resorting to data augmentation techniques. In this paper, by optimizing the parameters for BDA, we achieved exceptionally high performances in the phishing messages classification experiment, with 95.45% for Recall and 96.85% for the BA metric. Moreover, when compared with other algorithms, the proposed method demonstrated robustness against overfitting due to class imbalance problem and exhibited minimal performance disparity between training and testing.
